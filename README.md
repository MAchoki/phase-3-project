**BUSINESS PROBLEM**

Syriatel Telecommunications company is a telecommunications business based in Syria that is experiencing an issue with client turnover.This worries the company, and they would like to know if there will be more turnover in the future.This project not only enables them to understand it, but it also teaches them how to improve their interaction with users in order to sustain a high rate of customer retention and even attract a large number of new ones.

**DATA UNDERSTANDING**
We will work with a customer churn dataset from the telecom industry sourced from Kaggle website.
It contains 3,333 records and 21 columns(4 categorical, 17 numerical)

https://github.com/MAchoki/phase-3-project.git


14.5% of the company's user have left or churned from their services.

**OBJECTIVES**

Find out why customers are churning.
Develop a model that will accurately predict future rate of churning.
Find a probable solution to reduce churning.

**MODELLING**

Algorithms used:
Logistic Regression
Desicion Tree Classifier
Logistic Regression Classifier

** CONCLUSION**

- As our recall score for our model was .74 as good as it is a predictive model, more time is needed for further engineering to help improve this score.

- For SyriaTel to improve on customer retention they need to deploy the machine learning model to get realtime predicitions.
Realtime continuous monitoring ensure the model is always learning and improving with time. With use of feature importance on can leverage it to provide insight on how to target service improvements and personalize retention efforts.

**RECCOMENDATION**
A few ways into which SyriaTel can reduce Churning rate is by:
- Focusing on retention programss in area code 415 and 510 as these have the highest churning rate.
- Improve on quality customer service call:
- By having responsive customer support.Provide quick and effective customer support. Resolve issues promptly and ensure that customers feel heard and valued.
